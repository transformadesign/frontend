Furniture and lighting play a leading role, and when everything is complemented by the appropriate decor, we expect for the effect of a "happy surprise". And this happy feeling will stay for many years.',

So the art of matching details, the ability to work out a proper decor for a space is a first proof of the high quality service. The whole process is divided in four stages: preparation of specifications, design validation and control, negotiations with suppliers of furniture, accessories and decor, and then delivery and final strokes that make the picture complete.'
